        <h1>ABOUT PENDULUM</h1>
        <p>Pendulum is an Austrailian drum and bass and electronic rock band which was founded back in 2002. The band was originally formed in the city of 'Perth, Western Australia' ny Rob Swire, Gareth McGrillen and Paul Harding. Then later the band expanded to have members included like Ben Mount and Peredur ap Gwynedd and KJ Sawka Members Swire and McGrillen also formed the electro house duo Knife Party.<br> The group is notable for its distinctive sound, mixing electronic music with hard rock and covering a wide range of genres.
          <br>In 2003, Swire, McGrillen and Harding relocated to the United Kingdom. The debut studio album, Hold Your Colour, was released in 2005 to positive critical reception. While Hold Your Colour was mostly of the drum and bass genre, the succeeding albums In Silico and Immersion saw experimentation of other genres such as industrial rock and electronic rock</p>

        <p>2002â€“07: Formation and Hold Your Colour</p>
        <p>Before Pendulum, Rob Swire and Gareth McGrillen were in multiple rock and metal music bands before Swire influenced McGrillen into producing electronic music on their computers. Harding had been the drummer in a punk band since the mid 1990s. Both their bands had played together at the same shows, but they did not meet until a drum and bass night in 2002.[6] They all had a passion for electronic music and formed Pendulum, incorporating their previous influences of rock and metal music from their previous projects.</p>
